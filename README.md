# Ensuring Transparency in Takeovers: Evaluating Information Retrieval in the Indian Financial Market
The level of trust that retail investors exhibit has a big impact on the
growth of the capital market. Consequently, it is imperative to ensure the pro-
tection of their interests. To arrive at a well-informed conclusion, it is important
that all relevant information pertaining to the open offer during the takeover be
thoroughly and accurately given. The author released a preliminary dataset to
study the letter of offer document during the takeover process, along with some
basic questions required for retrieval. The author then measured some existing
evaluation metrics. This work is unique as it caters to the Indian financial mar-
ket and augments the analysis of takeover data using information retrieval. The
author has made noteworthy contributions by facilitating access to takeover da-
ta for the Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval community.
The raw data is in standard reusable format, ensuring its ease of use. Addition-
ally, the author has published a Q&A resource that can be used by regulators,
merchant bankers, and investors.
